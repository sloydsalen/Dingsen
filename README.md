# Dingsen
Arduino based temperatur logger project for KJM1101 - General Chemistry at the Univeristy of Oslo

## Strfucture
The repository(repo) is sepaated in to sections based on the used code√≠ng-language. All files should be constructed to maintain the relative paths. e.g. the Arduino-folder contains a subfolder for a project on the same level as the library folder. This enables the code to run properly when the repo is downloaded.
Changes to the repo-structure should *notf*few
