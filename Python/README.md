# Dingsen
Arduino based temperatur logger project for KJM1101 - General Chemistry at the Univeristy of Oslo

## Structure
The repository(repo) is sepaated in to sections based on the used code√≠ng-language. All files should be constructed to maintain the relative paths. e.g. the Arduino-folder contains a subfolder for a project on the same level as the library folder. This enables the code to run properly when the repo is downloaded.
Changes to the repo-structure should **not** be done without updating all other dependencies

### Issue tracking and project updates
Users and developers are strongly encouraged to use the **_Issues_-** or **_Projects_**-feature in GitHub to submit issues or suggestions for furture work etc.
